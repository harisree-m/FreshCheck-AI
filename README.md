# 🥗 Food Freshness & Quality Classifier

🚀 A computer vision–based ML application that evaluates food quality from images to help users make safer eating decisions.

## 🧩 Problem Statement (PS)

Consumers often struggle to determine whether food is fresh, safe, or should be avoided based solely on visual inspection. This uncertainty can lead to food waste or health risks. Existing solutions lack instant, accessible, and intelligent assessment of food quality from images.

FreshCheck AI addresses this problem by using computer vision and pre-trained vision models to analyze user-uploaded food images and classify them as **Fresh**, **Okay**, or **Avoid**, enabling smarter and safer food decisions.

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out
- 📷 Strong computer vision fundamentals
- 🌍 Practical real-life ML use case
- 🚫 Far more meaningful than demo or meme projects
- 🔄 Easily extensible to nutrition or waste reduction systems

## 📌 Resume Highlight
- Built an image classification system using pre-trained vision models to assess food quality from user-uploaded images.

## 🤝 Open for Collaboration
- Looking to improve dataset quality, model accuracy, and UI experience
- Contributions and ideas welcome!
