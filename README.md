# 🥗 Food Freshness & Quality Classifier

🚀 A computer vision–based ML application that evaluates food quality from images to help users make safer eating decisions.

## 🔍 What It Does
- 📸 User uploads a food image
- 🧠 Model analyzes visual features
- ✅ Predicts food condition: **Fresh / Okay / Avoid**
- 🍎 Can be extended to fruit ripeness or food category detection

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 👁️ Vision Models: Hugging Face pre-trained CV models
- 🐍 Backend: Python / JavaScript
- 🔌 Image Classification API
- 🌐 Frontend: Simple image uploader (Web / Mobile)

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out
- 📷 Strong computer vision fundamentals
- 🌍 Practical real-life ML use case
- 🚫 Far more meaningful than demo or meme projects
- 🔄 Easily extensible to nutrition or waste reduction systems

## 📌 Resume Highlight
- Built an image classification system using pre-trained vision models to assess food quality from user-uploaded images.

## 🤝 Open for Collaboration
- Looking to improve dataset quality, model accuracy, and UI experience
- Contributions and ideas welcome!
